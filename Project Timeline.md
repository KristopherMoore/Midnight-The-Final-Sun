UPDATE 7.24.18:
Strep Throat has kept me out of coding for awhile at this point. But still managed to get Some work done with both the Gliding System and Arrow system. For now we have the gliding system only missing refined animations, and wind tunnels still need to be implemented. For the Arrow / projectile system. Animations for the player and the camera shift have been done. But still need to animate the bow itself and define the projectile. So Im behind, but its manageable.
